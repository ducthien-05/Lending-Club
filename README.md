# üìä Lending Club Loan Default Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of loan default using the **Lending Club dataset** (Kaggle).  
By applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models, the system helps financial institutions make better lending decisions.  
Additionally, a **Gradio-based application** is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for loan default prediction.

## üöÄ Features
- Data preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values, outliers, and data cleaning.
  - Encoding categorical variables using **OrdinalEncoder** and **OneHotEncoder**.
  - Feature scaling with **MinMaxScaler**.
- Machine learning:
  - Built and trained a **Random Forest Classifier** for loan default prediction.
  - Stored trained models and preprocessing objects using **joblib**.
- Deployment:
  - Gradio web application for interactive loan default prediction.
  - User inputs borrower details and receives prediction with probability score.
